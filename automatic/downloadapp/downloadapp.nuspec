CNET TechTracker was discontinued and replaced with the Download App.
The Download App is a free application from CNET Download.com.
It helps keep the software on your Windows computer up-to-date, as well as clean up the junk that accumulates in your system over time.
The Download App scans your computer and notifies you when updates are available for the software you have installed.
Software updates contain new features and patches that make your computer more secure.
You can also use the Download App to remove unwanted software from your computer using the Uninstall feature.
Using the software catalog that powers Download.com, the Download App provides secure, spyware-free software updates, and makes it easy to keep track of all your software updates in one place.
Using the Utilities features, you can scan your computer for junk files that might be slowing your computer down and get rid of them with a few clicks.
