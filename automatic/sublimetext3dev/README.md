Sublime Text is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.

The _Dev Builds_ are the in-progress versions of Sublime Text 3, and are updated more frequently. Feel free to use them, but keep in mind you will be running less tested code, and you'll be seeing many more update notification prompts.
