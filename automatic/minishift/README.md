## Run OpenShift 3.x locally

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OKD locally by launching a single-node OKD cluster inside a virtual machine.
With Minishift you can try out OKD or develop with it, day-to-day, on your local machine.

Minishift uses [libmachine](https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine) for provisioning virtual machines,
and OKD3 for running the cluster.

### Note: Minishift runs OpenShift 3.x clusters. Due to different installation methods, OpenShift 4.x clusters are not supported. To run OpenShift 4.x locally, use CodeReady Containers
