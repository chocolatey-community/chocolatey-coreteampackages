    <summary>Brackets open-source code editor built with the web for the web.</summary>
    <description>
Brackets is an open-source editor for web design and development built on top of web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project was created and is maintained by Adobe, and is released under an MIT License.

**For the web, by the web**
Brackets is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you can code in Brackets, you can code on Brackets.

**Open development works**
Brackets, is a fully open-source, community-driven project. Want to influence its direction? Join the developer list and start contributing.

**Tools shouldn't get in your way**
Rather than clutter your workspace with floating panels, toolbars and icons, Brackets focuses on providing “Quick Edit” in-line views that provide context-sensitive access to your content, without taking you away from your code.

**Works with your browser**
The browser is your design view. Brackets hooks up directly to the browser, allowing you to design and develop in the same environment that you deploy.
