## Kustomize
`kustomize` lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML
untouched and usable as is.

`kustomize` targets kubernetes; it understands and can patch [kubernetes style] API objects.  It's like
[`make`], in that what it does is declared in a file, and it's like [`sed`], in that it emits editted text.

This tool is sponsored by [sig-cli] ([KEP]).

#### Note: Windows support is limited to 64bit systems.
